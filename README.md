#  CodeExplainer – Streaming LLM Responses in Jupyter

### This project demonstrates how to stream responses from Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI GPT-4o-mini and LLaMA (via Ollama) inside a Jupyter Notebook with real-time display updates.

### It is an interactive AI tool that can analyze, understand, and explain source code. Users simply pass their question or code into the question variable, and the system generates a live explanation.
